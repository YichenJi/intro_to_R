For R beginners, mastering the use of each package is one of the most important things in the learning process. As a statistician, the two most crucial jobs are to tidy raw data and create informative analysis to its audiences. Here, we will introduce some widely used packages by R scholars. The intention is to provide detailed explanation about the function of each introduced package in an intuitive manner. There should be no worry about jargons or over professional description in tutorials. 


So, grab your laptop (and possibly a drink if you wish) and get started!!!
